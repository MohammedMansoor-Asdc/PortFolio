            <h3>Snake Game</h3>
            <p>
                The Snake Game is a classic arcade game implemented in JavaScript. Players control a snake that grows longer as it consumes food while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own tail. I created this game to demonstrate my front-end development skills, including event handling, game mechanics, and user interaction.
